/**
 * point-guard's tests drive the real machinery rather than mocking it: each
 * one creates a git fixture repo, spawns detached worktrees, runs acceptance
 * checks in them and publishes through the merge queue. Several land between
 * 5 and 7 seconds on an idle machine, so vitest's 5s default failed them on
 * elapsed time rather than on behaviour — and failed a DIFFERENT test
 * whenever load shifted, which reads as flake instead of a budget that was
 * never big enough.
 *
 * 30s is chosen to be clear of the slowest case (~7s) with room for a loaded
 * CI runner, while still bounded: a genuinely hung test fails rather than
 * hanging the lane.
